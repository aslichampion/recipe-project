        Spice of life is here to make home cooking easy, fun and delicious.
        Planning out meals can be time consuming and frustrating, especially if
        you can't decide on a recipe. Yes, you could just make the same old
        meal, or, you could go for a meal delivery service, but that can get
        expensive.<br /><br />

        Instead, let us pick out some meals and write a shopping list. So you
        can focus on two things, the cooking, and life.<br /><br />

        If you ask us, we've got the easy bit...
